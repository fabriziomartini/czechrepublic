# Day Trips & Additional Places

- **Kutna Hora Ossuary** - bone ossuary (amazing) (day trip only)
- **Karlovy Vary**
- **Brno**
- **Cesky Krumlov** - small but very beautiful; kind of far and maybe not worth it if limited on time
- **Zlute Lazne** - private swimming area
- **Pruhonice Chateau/Park** - about an hour outside of Prague â€” really beautiful
- **Karlstejn Castle**
